# Overview

Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by *Guido van Rossum* and first released in 1991. An **interpreted language**, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. **CPython**, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. **CPython** is managed by the non-profit [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).

## Python Software Foundation (PSF)

The [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/) is an independent non-profit organization that holds the copyright on Python versions 2.1 and newer. The PSF’s mission is to advance open source technology related to the Python programming language and to publicize the use of Python.

## Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

Python's development is conducted largely through the **Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)** process. The PEP process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community and by Van Rossum, the Python project's benevolent dictator for life. Refer to [Index of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/).

# Python Implementations

There are some alternate implementations which are of particular interest to different audiences. Known implementations include:

* **CPython**

    This is the original and most-maintained implementation of Python, written in **C**. New language features generally appear here first.

* **Jython**

    Python implemented in **Java**. This implementation can be used as a scripting language for Java applications, or can be used to create applications using the Java class libraries. It is also often used to create tests for Java libraries. More information can be found at [the Jython website](http://www.jython.org/).

* **Python for .NET**

    This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation, but is a managed .NET application and makes .NET libraries available. It was created by Brian Lloyd. For more information, see the [Python for .NET home page](https://pythonnet.github.io/).

* **IronPython**

    An alternate Python for .NET. Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete Python implementation that generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET assemblies. It was created by Jim Hugunin, the original creator of Jython. For more information, see [the IronPython website](http://ironpython.net/).

* **PyPy**

    An implementation of Python written completely in **Python**. It supports several advanced features not found in other implementations like stackless support and a Just in Time compiler. One of the goals of the project is to encourage experimentation with the language itself by making it easier to modify the interpreter (since it is written in Python). Additional information is available on [the PyPy project’s home page](http://pypy.org/).

## CPython

The latest development sources of Python can be obtained at [Git Repo](https://github.com/python/cpython/):

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ git clone https://github.com/python/cpython.git
```

Directory structure of CPython source tree is listed below:

* Tools

    Various tools that are (or have been) used to maintain Python.

### Building CPython

On Debian, Ubuntu, and other **apt** based systems, try to get the dependencies for the Python version that you’re working on. If that package is not available for your system, try reducing the minor version until you find a package that is available.

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ sudo apt-get build-dep python3.5
```

Run the following command to build Python from source code, refer to [Getting Started section of the Python Developer’s Guide](https://docs.python.org/devguide/setup.html) for details:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ cd cpython/

chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ git co v3.6.1
HEAD is now at 69c0db5050f6... Update docs and patchlevel for 3.6.1 final

chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ ./configure --with-pydebug

chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ make -s -j2
...
Python build finished successfully!
The necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:
_bz2                  _lzma                                    
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

The following modules found by detect_modules() in setup.py, have been
built by the Makefile instead, as configured by the Setup files:
atexit                pwd                   time               

Failed to build these modules:
_tkinter

-rwxrwxr-x 1 chenwx chenwx 11M Mar 29 17:33 python
chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ ./python -V
Python 3.6.1
```

There is normally no need to install your built copy of Python because which is already installed by Linux distributions, refer to [Python Installation](#python-installation).

# Python Language

Python documentation:

* [Python 2.x Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/)
* [Python 3.x Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

For C or C++ programmers, two additional manuals exist:

* [Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html#extending-index) describes the high-level picture of how to write a Python extension module
* [Python/C API Reference Manual](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html#c-api-index) describes the interfaces available to C/C++ programmers in detail

## Keywords

The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or *keywords* of the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. They must be spelled exactly as written here:

```
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise
```

## Operators

The following tokens are operators:

```
+       -       *       **      /       //      %      @
<<      >>      &       |       ^       ~
<       >       <=      >=      ==      !=
```

![Python_Operator_Precedence](/assets/Python_Operators.png)

Python operator precedence:

![Python_Operator_Precedence](/assets/Python_Operator_Precedence.png)

## Delimiters

The following tokens serve as delimiters in the grammar:

```
(       )       [       ]       {       }
,       :       .       ;       @       =       ->
+=      -=      *=      /=      //=     %=      @=
&=      |=      ^=      >>=     <<=     **=
```

The period can also occur in floating-point and imaginary literals. A sequence of three periods has a special meaning as an ellipsis literal. The second half of the list, the augmented assignment operators, serve lexically as delimiters, but also perform an operation.

The following printing ASCII characters have special meaning as part of other tokens or are otherwise significant to the lexical analyzer:

```
'       "       #       \
```

The following printing ASCII characters are not used in Python. Their occurrence outside string literals and comments is an unconditional error:

```
$       ?       `
```

## Comments

**One Line Comments**

Typically, you just use the pound sign (```#```) to comment out everything that follows it on that line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.

```
#print("Am a comment")
```

If a comment in the **first or second line of the Python script** matches the regular expression ```coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+)```, this comment is processed as an **encoding declaration**; the first group of this expression names the encoding of the source code file. The encoding declaration must appear on a line of its own. If it is the second line, the first line must also be a comment-only line. The recommended forms of an encoding expression are

```
# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-
```

which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and

```
# vim:fileencoding=<encoding-name>
```

which is recognized by Bram Moolenaar’s VIM.

If no encoding declaration is found, the default encoding is **UTF-8**. If an encoding is declared, the encoding name must be recognized by Python. The encoding is used for all lexical analysis, including string literals, comments and identifiers.

**Multiple Line Comments**

Multiple line comments simply use 3 single quotes (```'''```) before and after the part you want commented:

```
'''
print("We are in a comment")
print("We are still in a comment")
'''
print("We are out of the comment")
```

## Indentation

Indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. Each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.

## Data Structures

### Lists

Run the following command to check help information of list:

```
>>> help(list)
```

Create a list:

```
>>> squares = []
>>> for x in range(10):
...     squares.append(x**2)
...
>>> squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

or,

```
>>> squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
>>> squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

or,

```
>>> squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))
>>> squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

Lists are mutable.

There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the ```del``` statement. This differs from the ```pop()``` method which returns a value. The ```del``` statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list.

```
>>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]
>>> del a[0]
>>> a
[1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]
>>> del a[2:4]
>>> a
[1, 66.25, 1234.5]
>>> del a[:]
>>> a
[]
```

```del``` can also be used to delete entire variables:

```
>>> del a
>>> a
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

Referencing the name ```a``` hereafter is an error, at least until another value is assigned to it.

### Tuples

Run the following command to check help information of tuple:

```
>>> help(tuple)
```

A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas:

```
>>> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
>>> t[0]
12345
>>> t
(12345, 54321, 'hello!')
>>> # Tuples may be nested:
... u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
>>> u
((12345, 54321, 'hello!'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
>>> # Tuples are immutable:
... t[0] = 88888
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>> # but they can contain mutable objects:
... v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
>>> v
([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
```

Tuples are immutable. It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists.

A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective.

```
>>> empty = ()
>>> singleton = 'hello',    # <-- note trailing comma
>>> len(empty)
0
>>> len(singleton)
1
>>> singleton
('hello',)
```

This is *sequence unpacking* and works for any sequence on the right-hand side. Sequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the sequence. Note that *multiple assignment* is really just a combination of *tuple packing* and *sequence unpacking*.

```
>>> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
>>> t
(12345, 54321, 'hello!')
>>> x, y, z = t
>>> x
12345
>>> y
54321
>>> z
'hello!'
```

### Sets

Run the following command to check help information of set:

```
>>> help(set)
```

A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

Curly braces or the ```set()``` function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use ```set()```, not ```{}```; the latter creates an empty dictionary.

```
>>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
>>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed
{'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}
>>> basket
set(['orange', 'pear', 'banana', 'apple'])
>>> 'orange' in basket                 # fast membership testing
True
>>> 'crabgrass' in basket
False

>>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words
...
>>> a = set('abracadabra')
>>> b = set('alacazam')
>>> a                                  # unique letters in a
{'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
>>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b
{'r', 'd', 'b'}
>>> a | b                              # letters in either a or b
{'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
>>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b
{'a', 'c'}
>>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both
{'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
```

### Dictionaries

Run the following command to check help information of dict:

```
help(dict)
```

Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be *keys*.

It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of *key: value* pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: ```{}```. Placing a comma-separated list of *key:value* pairs within the braces adds initial *key:value* pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.

The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a *key:value* pair with ```del```. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key.

To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the ```in``` keyword.

```
>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
>>> tel['guido'] = 4127
>>> tel
{'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}
>>> tel['jack']
4098
>>> del tel['sape']
>>> tel['irv'] = 4127
>>> tel
{'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127, 'jack': 4098}
>>> list(tel.keys())
['irv', 'guido', 'jack']
>>> sorted(tel.keys())
['guido', 'irv', 'jack']
>>> 'guido' in tel
True
>>> 'jack' not in tel
False
```

The ```dict()``` constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs:

```
>>> dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])
{'sape': 4139, 'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127}
```

In addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from arbitrary key and value expressions:

```
>>> {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}
{2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}
```

When the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using keyword arguments:

```
>>> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098)
{'sape': 4139, 'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127}
```

When looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the ```items()``` method.

```
>>> knights = {'gallahad': 'the pure', 'robin': 'the brave'}
>>> for k, v in knights.items():
...     print(k, v)
...
gallahad the pure
robin the brave
```

## Statements

### if..elif..else

There can be zero or more ```elif``` parts, and the ```else``` part is optional.

```
>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...
```

### for

The ```for``` statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s ```for``` statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

```
>>> for i in range(5):
...     print(i)
...
0
1
2
3
4
```

```
>>> words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
>>> for w in words:
...     print(w, len(w))
...
('cat', 3)
('window', 6)
('defenestrate', 12)
```

If you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop (for example to duplicate selected items), it is recommended that you first make a copy. Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly make a copy. The *slice notation* makes this especially convenient:

```
>>> for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.
...     if len(w) > 6:
...         words.insert(0, w)
...
>>> words
['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
```

### while

In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false.

```
>>> # Fibonacci series: the sum of two elements defines the next
... a, b = 0, 1
>>> while b < 10:
...     print(b)
...     a, b = b, a+b
...
1
1
2
3
5
8
```

### break, continue and else clauses on Loops

The ```break``` statement, like in C, breaks out of the smallest enclosing ```for``` or ```while``` loop.

The ```continue``` statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:

```
>>> for num in range(2, 10):
...     if num % 2 == 0:
...         print("Found an even number", num)
...         continue
...     print("Found a number", num)
Found an even number 2
Found a number 3
Found an even number 4
Found a number 5
Found an even number 6
Found a number 7
Found an even number 8
Found a number 9
```

Loop statements may have an ```else``` clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with ```for```) or when the condition becomes false (with ```while```), but not when the loop is terminated by a ```break``` statement.

```
>>> for n in range(2, 10):
...     for x in range(2, n):
...         if n % x == 0:
...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
...             break
...     else:
...         # loop fell through without finding a factor
...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
...
2 is a prime number
3 is a prime number
4 equals 2 * 2
5 is a prime number
6 equals 2 * 3
7 is a prime number
8 equals 2 * 4
9 equals 3 * 3
```

### pass

The ```pass``` statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.

```
>>> def initlog(*args):
...     pass   # Remember to implement this!
...
```

### Multiple Assignment

```
# Fibonacci series: the sum of two elements defines the next
a, b = 0, 1
while (b < 10)
    print(b)
    a, b = b, a+b
```

The expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.

## Functions

The keyword ```def``` introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.

```
>>> def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
...     """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""
...     a, b = 0, 1
...     while a < n:
...         print(a, end=' ')
...         a, b = b, a+b
...     print()
...
>>> # Now call the function we just defined:
... fib(2000)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597
```

A function definition introduces the function name in the current symbol table. The value of the function name has a type that is recognized by the interpreter as a user-defined function. This value can be assigned to another name which can then also be used as a function. This serves as a general renaming mechanism:

```
>>> fib
<function fib at 10042ed0>
>>> f = fib
>>> f(100)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
```

The ```return``` statement returns with a value from a function. ```return``` without an expression argument returns ```None```. Falling off the end of a function also returns ```None```.

```
>>> def fib2(n):  # return Fibonacci series up to n
...     """Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n."""
...     result = []
...     a, b = 0, 1
...     while a < n:
...         result.append(a)    # see below
...         a, b = b, a+b
...     return result
...
>>> f100 = fib2(100)    # call it
>>> f100                # write the result
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
```

### Documentation Strings

The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s documentation string, or *docstring*.

The first line should always be a short, concise summary of the object’s purpose. For brevity, it should not explicitly state the object’s name or type, since these are available by other means (except if the name happens to be a verb describing a function’s operation). This line should begin with a capital letter and end with a period.

If there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be blank, visually separating the summary from the rest of the description. The following lines should be one or more paragraphs describing the object’s calling conventions, its side effects, etc.

The Python parser does not strip indentation from multi-line string literals in Python, so tools that process documentation have to strip indentation if desired. This is done using the following convention. The first non-blank line *after* the first line of the string determines the amount of indentation for the entire documentation string. (We can’t use the first line since it is generally adjacent to the string’s opening quotes so its indentation is not apparent in the string literal.) Whitespace *equivalent* to this indentation is then stripped from the start of all lines of the string. Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they occur all their leading whitespace should be stripped. Equivalence of whitespace should be tested after expansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally).

```
>>> def my_function():
...     """Do nothing, but document it.
...
...     No, really, it doesn't do anything.
...     """
...     pass
...
>>> print(my_function.__doc__)
Do nothing, but document it.

    No, really, it doesn't do anything.
```

### Default Argument Values

The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in the *defining scope*:

```
>>> i = 5
>>> def f(arg = i):
...     print(arg)
...
>>> i = 6
>>> f()
5
```

The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. The following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:

```
>>> def f(a, L = []):
...     L.append(a)
...     return L
...
>>> print(f(1))
[1]
>>> print(f(2))
[1, 2]
>>> print(f(3))
[1, 2, 3]
```

If you don’t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:

```
>>> def f(a, L=None):
...     if L is None:
...         L = []
...     L.append(a)
...     return L
...
>>> print(f(1))
[1]
>>> print(f(2))
[2]
>>> print(f(3))
[3]
```

### Keyword Arguments

Functions can also be called using *keyword arguments* of the form ```kwarg=value```. The function:

```
>>> def parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom', type='Norwegian Blue'):
...     print("-- This parrot wouldn't", action, end=' ')
...     print("if you put", voltage, "volts through it.")
...     print("-- Lovely plumage, the", type)
...     print("-- It's", state, "!")
...
```

can be called in any of the following ways:

```
parrot(1000)                                          # 1 positional argument
parrot(voltage=1000)                                  # 1 keyword argument
parrot(voltage=1000000, action='VOOOOOM')             # 2 keyword arguments
parrot(action='VOOOOOM', voltage=1000000)             # 2 keyword arguments
parrot('a million', 'bereft of life', 'jump')         # 3 positional arguments
parrot('a thousand', state='pushing up the daisies')  # 1 positional, 1 keyword
```

Note:

* In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments.
* All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function and their order is not important.
* No argument may receive a value more than once.

When a final formal parameter of the form ```**name``` is present, it receives a *dictionary* containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form ```*name``` which receives a *tuple* containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. ```*name``` must occur before ```**name```.

### Arbitrary Argument Lists

A function can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments. These arguments will be wrapped up in a *tuple*. Before the variable number of arguments, zero or more normal arguments may occur.

```
def write_multiple_items(file, separator, *args):
    file.write(separator.join(args))
```

Normally, these variadic arguments will be **last** in the list of formal parameters, because they scoop up all remaining input arguments that are passed to the function. Any formal parameters which occur after the ```*args``` parameter are *keyword-only* arguments, meaning that they can only be used as keywords rather than positional arguments.

```
>>> def concat(*args, sep="/"):
...     return sep.join(args)
...
>>> concat("earth", "mars", "venus")            # sep = "/" in this case
'earth/mars/venus'
>>> concat("earth", "mars", "venus", sep=".")   # sep = "." in this case
'earth.mars.venus'
```

### Unpacking Argument Lists

The reverse situation occurs when the arguments are already in a **list** or **tuple** but need to be unpacked for a function call requiring separate positional arguments. If they are not available separately, write the function call with the ```*```-operator to unpack the arguments out of a **list** or **tuple**:

```
>>> list(range(3, 6))        # normal call with separate arguments
[3, 4, 5]
>>> args = [3, 6]
>>> list(range(*args))       # call with arguments unpacked from a list
[3, 4, 5]
```

In the same fashion, **dictionaries** can deliver keyword arguments with the ```**```-operator:

```
>>> def parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom'):
...     print("-- This parrot wouldn't", action, end=' ')
...     print("if you put", voltage, "volts through it.", end=' ')
...     print("E's", state, "!")
...
>>> d = {"voltage": "four million", "state": "bleedin' demised", "action": "VOOM"}
>>> parrot(**d)
-- This parrot wouldn't VOOM if you put four million volts through it. E's bleedin' demised !
```

### Lambda Expressions

Small anonymous functions can be created with the ```lambda``` keyword. This function returns the sum of its two arguments: ```lambda a, b: a+b```. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function definition. Like nested function definitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope:

```
>>> def make_incrementor(n):
...     return lambda x: x + n
...
>>> f = make_incrementor(42)
>>> f(0)
42
>>> f(1)
43
```

The above example uses a lambda expression to return a function. Another use is to pass a small function as an argument:

```
>>> pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]
>>> pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])
>>> pairs
[(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]
```

### Function Annotations

Function annotations are completely optional metadata information about the types used by user-defined functions, see [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) for more information.

Annotations are stored in the ```__annotations__``` attribute of the function as a dictionary and have no effect on any other part of the function.

Parameter annotations are defined by a colon after the parameter name, followed by an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation.

Return annotations are defined by a literal ```->```, followed by an expression, between the parameter list and the colon denoting the end of the ```def``` statement. The following example has a positional argument, a keyword argument, and the return value annotated:

```
>>> def f(ham: str, eggs: str = 'eggs') -> str:
...     print("Annotations:", f.__annotations__)
...     print("Arguments:", ham, eggs)
...     return ham + ' and ' + eggs
...
>>> f('spam')
Annotations: {'ham': <class 'str'>, 'return': <class 'str'>, 'eggs': <class 'str'>}
Arguments: spam eggs
'spam and eggs'
```

## Modules

If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead.

To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a *module*; definitions from a module can be *imported* into other modules or into the *main* module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix **.py** appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable **__name__**. For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a file called *fibo.py* in the current directory with the following contents:

```
# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        print(b, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()

def fib2(n):   # return Fibonacci series up to n
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        result.append(b)
        a, b = b, a+b
    return result
```

Now enter the Python interpreter and import this module and access the functions with the following command:

```
>>> import fibo

>>> fibo.fib(1000)
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987
>>> fibo.fib2(100)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

>>> fibo.__name__
'fibo'

>>> fib = fibo.fib
>>> fib(500)
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
```

A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions. These statements are intended to initialize the module. They are executed only the first time the module name is encountered in an import statement.

Each module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the global symbol table by all functions defined in the module. Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without worrying about accidental clashes with a user’s global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a module’s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions, ```modname.itemname```.

Modules can import other modules. It is customary but not required to place all ```import``` statements at the beginning of a module (or script, for that matter). The imported module names are placed in the importing module’s global symbol table.

There is a variant of the ```import``` statement that imports names from a module directly into the importing module’s symbol table. This does not introduce the module name from which the imports are taken in the local symbol table (so in the example, *fibo* is not defined):

```
>>> from fibo import fib, fib2
>>> fib(500)
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
```

There is even a variant to import all names that a module defines. This imports all names except those beginning with an underscore ```_```:

```
>>> from fibo import *
>>> fib(500)
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
```

### Executing modules as scripts

When you run a Python module with following command, the code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the ```__name__``` set to ```__main__```.

```
python fibo.py <arguments>
```

or, by adding this code at the end of your module:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    fib(int(sys.argv[1]))
```

you can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable module, because the code that parses the command line only runs if the module is executed as the main file:

```
$ python fibo.py 50
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

### Module Search Path

When a module named *spam* is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named *spam.py* in a list of directories given by the variable ```sys.path```, which is initialized from these locations:

* The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified).
* PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).
* The installation-dependent default.

Note: On file systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the input script is calculated after the symlink is followed. In other words the directory containing the symlink is **not** added to the module search path.

After initialization, Python programs can modify ```sys.path```. The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended.

    Another python GUI library. It is the same library in which the famous Bittorrent client is created.

* [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/)

    A packet sniffer and analyzer for Python made in Python.

* [PyWin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)

    A Python library which provides some useful methods and classes for interacting with windows.

* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)

    Natural Language Toolkit – I realize most people won’t be using this one, but it’s generic enough. It is a very useful library if you want to manipulate strings. But it’s capacity is beyond that. Do check it out.

* [nose](http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/)

    A testing framework for Python. It is used by millions of Python developers. It is a must have if you do test driven development.

* [SymPy](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/)

    SymPy can do algebraic evaluation, differentiation, expansion, complex numbers, etc. It is contained in a pure Python distribution.

* [IPython](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/)

    I just can’t stress enough how useful this tool is. It is a Python prompt on steroids. It has completion, history, shell capabilities, and a lot more. Make sure that you take a look at it.

# Python Code Conventions

For Python, [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:


* Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.

    4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.

* Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.

    This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.

* Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.

* When possible, put comments on a line of their own.

* Use docstrings.

* Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: ```a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)```.

* Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use *CamelCase* for classes and *lower_case_with_underscores* for functions and methods. Always use ```self``` as the name for the first method argument.

* Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.

Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.

# Python Commands

## Command Options

When invoking Python, you may specify any of these options, refer to [command line and environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html):

```
python [-bBdEhiIOqsSuvVWx?] [-c command | -m module-name | script | - ] [args]
```

| Options | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| ```-?```<br>```-h```<br>```--help``` | Print a short description of all command line options. |
| ```-V```<br>```--version```<br>```-VV``` | Print the Python version number and exit. When given twice (```-VV```), print more information about the build. |
| ```-b```<br>```-bb``` | Issue a warning when comparing ```bytes``` or ```bytearray``` with ```str``` or ```bytes``` with ```int```. Issue an error when the option is given twice (```-bb```). Changed in version 3.5: Affects comparisons of ```bytes``` with ```int```. |
| ```-B``` | If given, Python won’t try to write **.pyc** files on the import of source modules. See also **PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE**. |
| ```-d``` | Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only, depending on compilation options). See also **PYTHONDEBUG**. |
| ```-E``` | Ignore all **PYTHON\*** environment variables, e.g. **PYTHONPATH** and **PYTHONHOME**, that might be set. |
| ```-i``` | When a script is passed as first argument or the ```-c``` option is used, enter **interactive mode** after executing the script or the command, even when **sys.stdin** does not appear to be a terminal. The **PYTHONSTARTUP** file is not read. This can be useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception. See also **PYTHONINSPECT**. |
| ```-I``` | Run Python in **isolated mode**. This also implies **-E** and **-s**. In isolated mode **sys.path** contains neither the script’s directory nor the user’s site-packages directory. All **PYTHON\*** environment variables are ignored too. Further restrictions may be imposed to prevent the user from injecting malicious code. New in version 3.4. |
| ```-O``` | Turn on basic optimizations. See also **PYTHONOPTIMIZE**. |
| ```-OO``` | Discard *docstrings* in addition to the **-O** optimizations. |
| ```-q``` | Don’t display the copyright and version messages even in **interactive mode**. New in version 3.2. |
| ```-R``` | Kept for compatibility. On Python 3.3 and greater, hash randomization is turned on by default. On previous versions of Python, this option turns on hash randomization, so that the ```__hash__()``` values of ```str```, ```bytes``` and ```datetime``` are salted with an unpredictable random value. Although they remain constant within an individual Python process, they are not predictable between repeated invocations of Python. |
| ```-s``` | Don’t add the user site-packages directory to **sys.path**. |
| ```-S``` | Disable the import of the module site and the site-dependent manipulations of **sys.path** that it entails. Also disable these manipulations if site is explicitly imported later (call ```site.main()``` if you want them to be triggered). |
| ```-u``` | Force the binary layer of the **stdout** and **stderr** streams (which is available as their buffer attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console, or block-buffered if redirected to a non-interactive file. See also **PYTHONUNBUFFERED**. |
| ```-v```<br>```-vv``` | Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded. When given twice (```-vv```), print a message for each file that is checked for when searching for a module. Also provides information on module cleanup at exit. See also **PYTHONVERBOSE**. |
| ```-W arg``` | Warning control. Python’s warning machinery by default prints warning messages to **sys.stderr**. |
| ```-x``` | Skip the first line of the source, allowing use of non-Unix forms of ```#!cmd```. This is intended for a **DOS specific hack only**. |
| ```-X``` | Reserved for various implementation-specific options. |
| ```-J``` | Reserved for use by **Jython**. You shouldn’t use this option. |

<p/>

Run the following command to print a short description of all command line options:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ python -V
Python 2.7.12
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ python -h
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-B     : don't write .py[co] files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : debug output from parser; also PYTHONDEBUG=x
-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit (also --help)
-i     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
         if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
-m mod : run library module as a script (terminates option list)
-O     : optimize generated bytecode slightly; also PYTHONOPTIMIZE=x
-OO    : remove doc-strings in addition to the -O optimizations
-R     : use a pseudo-random salt to make hash() values of various types be
         unpredictable between separate invocations of the interpreter, as
         a defense against denial-of-service attacks
-Q arg : division options: -Qold (default), -Qwarn, -Qwarnall, -Qnew
-s     : don't add user site directory to sys.path; also PYTHONNOUSERSITE
-S     : don't imply 'import site' on initialization
-t     : issue warnings about inconsistent tab usage (-tt: issue errors)
-u     : unbuffered binary stdout and stderr; also PYTHONUNBUFFERED=x
         see man page for details on internal buffering relating to '-u'
-v     : verbose (trace import statements); also PYTHONVERBOSE=x
         can be supplied multiple times to increase verbosity
-V     : print the Python version number and exit (also --version)
-W arg : warning control; arg is action:message:category:module:lineno
         also PYTHONWARNINGS=arg
-x     : skip first line of source, allowing use of non-Unix forms of #!cmd
-3     : warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix
file   : program read from script file
-      : program read from stdin (default; interactive mode if a tty)
arg ...: arguments passed to program in sys.argv[1:]

Other environment variables:
PYTHONSTARTUP: file executed on interactive startup (no default)
PYTHONPATH   : ':'-separated list of directories prefixed to the
               default module search path.  The result is sys.path.
PYTHONHOME   : alternate <prefix> directory (or <prefix>:<exec_prefix>).
               The default module search path uses <prefix>/pythonX.X.
PYTHONCASEOK : ignore case in 'import' statements (Windows).
PYTHONIOENCODING: Encoding[:errors] used for stdin/stdout/stderr.
PYTHONHASHSEED: if this variable is set to 'random', the effect is the same
   as specifying the -R option: a random value is used to seed the hashes of
   str, bytes and datetime objects.  It can also be set to an integer
   in the range [0,4294967295] to get hash values with a predictable seed.
```

Or, you can find descriptions of those options in man page:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ man python
```

Or, run the following command to print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded:

## Environment Variables

The environment variables influence Python’s behavior, they are processed **before** the command-line switches other than ```-E``` or ```-I```. It is customary that command-line switches override environmental variables where there is a conflict. Refer to [command line and environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html) for details.
