# Overview

Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by *Guido van Rossum* and first released in 1991. An **interpreted language**, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. **CPython**, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. **CPython** is managed by the non-profit [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).

## Python Software Foundation (PSF)

The [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/) is an independent non-profit organization that holds the copyright on Python versions 2.1 and newer. The PSF’s mission is to advance open source technology related to the Python programming language and to publicize the use of Python.

## Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

Python's development is conducted largely through the **Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)** process. The PEP process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community and by Van Rossum, the Python project's benevolent dictator for life. Refer to [Index of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/).

    A numerical plotting library. It is very useful for any data scientist or any data analyzer.

* [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html)

    Which developer does not like to play games and develop them? This library will help you achieve your goal of 2D game development.

* [Pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/)

    A 3D animation and game creation engine. This is the engine in which the famous python port of [Minecraft](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft) was made.

* [pyQT](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/)

    A GUI toolkit for python. It is my second choice after [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/) for developing GUI’s for my python scripts.

* [pyGtk](http://www.pygtk.org/)

    Another python GUI library. It is the same library in which the famous Bittorrent client is created.

* [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/)

    A packet sniffer and analyzer for Python made in Python.

* [PyWin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)

    A Python library which provides some useful methods and classes for interacting with windows.

* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)

    Natural Language Toolkit – I realize most people won’t be using this one, but it’s generic enough. It is a very useful library if you want to manipulate strings. But it’s capacity is beyond that. Do check it out.

* [nose](http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/)

    A testing framework for Python. It is used by millions of Python developers. It is a must have if you do test driven development.

* [SymPy](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/)

    SymPy can do algebraic evaluation, differentiation, expansion, complex numbers, etc. It is contained in a pure Python distribution.

* [IPython](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/)

    I just can’t stress enough how useful this tool is. It is a Python prompt on steroids. It has completion, history, shell capabilities, and a lot more. Make sure that you take a look at it.

# Python Commands

## Command Options

When invoking Python, you may specify any of these options, refer to [command line and environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html):

```
python [-bBdEhiIOqsSuvVWx?] [-c command | -m module-name | script | - ] [args]
```

| Options | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| ```-?```<br>```-h```<br>```--help``` | Print a short description of all command line options. |
| ```-V```<br>```--version```<br>```-VV``` | Print the Python version number and exit. When given twice (```-VV```), print more information about the build. |
| ```-b```<br>```-bb``` | Issue a warning when comparing ```bytes``` or ```bytearray``` with ```str``` or ```bytes``` with ```int```. Issue an error when the option is given twice (```-bb```). Changed in version 3.5: Affects comparisons of ```bytes``` with ```int```. |
| ```-B``` | If given, Python won’t try to write **.pyc** files on the import of source modules. See also **PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE**. |
| ```-d``` | Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only, depending on compilation options). See also **PYTHONDEBUG**. |
| ```-E``` | Ignore all **PYTHON\*** environment variables, e.g. **PYTHONPATH** and **PYTHONHOME**, that might be set. |
| ```-i``` | When a script is passed as first argument or the ```-c``` option is used, enter **interactive mode** after executing the script or the command, even when **sys.stdin** does not appear to be a terminal. The **PYTHONSTARTUP** file is not read. This can be useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception. See also **PYTHONINSPECT**. |
| ```-I``` | Run Python in **isolated mode**. This also implies **-E** and **-s**. In isolated mode **sys.path** contains neither the script’s directory nor the user’s site-packages directory. All **PYTHON\*** environment variables are ignored too. Further restrictions may be imposed to prevent the user from injecting malicious code. New in version 3.4. |
| ```-O``` | Turn on basic optimizations. See also **PYTHONOPTIMIZE**. |
| ```-OO``` | Discard *docstrings* in addition to the **-O** optimizations. |
| ```-q``` | Don’t display the copyright and version messages even in **interactive mode**. New in version 3.2. |
| ```-R``` | Kept for compatibility. On Python 3.3 and greater, hash randomization is turned on by default. On previous versions of Python, this option turns on hash randomization, so that the ```__hash__()``` values of ```str```, ```bytes``` and ```datetime``` are salted with an unpredictable random value. Although they remain constant within an individual Python process, they are not predictable between repeated invocations of Python. |
| ```-s``` | Don’t add the user site-packages directory to **sys.path**. |
| ```-S``` | Disable the import of the module site and the site-dependent manipulations of **sys.path** that it entails. Also disable these manipulations if site is explicitly imported later (call ```site.main()``` if you want them to be triggered). |
| ```-u``` | Force the binary layer of the **stdout** and **stderr** streams (which is available as their buffer attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console, or block-buffered if redirected to a non-interactive file. See also **PYTHONUNBUFFERED**. |
| ```-v```<br>```-vv``` | Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded. When given twice (```-vv```), print a message for each file that is checked for when searching for a module. Also provides information on module cleanup at exit. See also **PYTHONVERBOSE**. |
| ```-W arg``` | Warning control. Python’s warning machinery by default prints warning messages to **sys.stderr**. |
| ```-x``` | Skip the first line of the source, allowing use of non-Unix forms of ```#!cmd```. This is intended for a **DOS specific hack only**. |
| ```-X``` | Reserved for various implementation-specific options. |
| ```-J``` | Reserved for use by **Jython**. You shouldn’t use this option. |

<p/>

## Environment Variables

The environment variables influence Python’s behavior, they are processed **before** the command-line switches other than ```-E``` or ```-I```. It is customary that command-line switches override environmental variables where there is a conflict. Refer to [command line and environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html) for details.
