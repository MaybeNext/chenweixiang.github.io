# Overview

Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by *Guido van Rossum* and first released in 1991. An **interpreted language**, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. **CPython**, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. **CPython** is managed by the non-profit [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).

## Python Software Foundation (PSF)

The [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/) is an independent non-profit organization that holds the copyright on Python versions 2.1 and newer. The PSF’s mission is to advance open source technology related to the Python programming language and to publicize the use of Python.

## Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

Python's development is conducted largely through the **Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)** process. The PEP process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community and by Van Rossum, the Python project's benevolent dictator for life. Refer to [Index of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/).

# Python Implementations

There are some alternate implementations which are of particular interest to different audiences. Known implementations include:

* **CPython**

    This is the original and most-maintained implementation of Python, written in **C**. New language features generally appear here first.

* **Jython**

    Python implemented in **Java**. This implementation can be used as a scripting language for Java applications, or can be used to create applications using the Java class libraries. It is also often used to create tests for Java libraries. More information can be found at [the Jython website](http://www.jython.org/).

* **Python for .NET**

    This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation, but is a managed .NET application and makes .NET libraries available. It was created by Brian Lloyd. For more information, see the [Python for .NET home page](https://pythonnet.github.io/).

* **IronPython**

    An alternate Python for .NET. Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete Python implementation that generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET assemblies. It was created by Jim Hugunin, the original creator of Jython. For more information, see [the IronPython website](http://ironpython.net/).

* **PyPy**

    An implementation of Python written completely in **Python**. It supports several advanced features not found in other implementations like stackless support and a Just in Time compiler. One of the goals of the project is to encourage experimentation with the language itself by making it easier to modify the interpreter (since it is written in Python). Additional information is available on [the PyPy project’s home page](http://pypy.org/).

## CPython

The latest development sources of Python can be obtained at [Git Repo](https://github.com/python/cpython/):

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ git clone https://github.com/python/cpython.git
```

Directory structure of CPython source tree is listed below:

* Python

    The code that makes up the core CPython runtime. This includes the compiler, eval loop and various built-in modules.

* Tools

    Various tools that are (or have been) used to maintain Python.

### Building CPython

On Debian, Ubuntu, and other **apt** based systems, try to get the dependencies for the Python version that you’re working on. If that package is not available for your system, try reducing the minor version until you find a package that is available.

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ sudo apt-get build-dep python3.5
```

Run the following command to build Python from source code, refer to [Getting Started section of the Python Developer’s Guide](https://docs.python.org/devguide/setup.html) for details:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ cd cpython/

chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ git co v3.6.1
HEAD is now at 69c0db5050f6... Update docs and patchlevel for 3.6.1 final

chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ ./configure --with-pydebug
...

config.status: creating Modules/Setup.config
config.status: creating Misc/python.pc
config.status: creating Misc/python-config.sh
config.status: creating Modules/ld_so_aix
config.status: creating pyconfig.h
config.status: pyconfig.h is unchanged

chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ make -s -j2
...
Python build finished successfully!
The necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:
_bz2                  _lzma                                    
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

The following modules found by detect_modules() in setup.py, have been
built by the Makefile instead, as configured by the Setup files:
atexit                pwd                   time               

Failed to build these modules:
_tkinter

chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ ll python
-rwxrwxr-x 1 chenwx chenwx 11M Mar 29 17:33 python
chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ ./python -V
Python 3.6.1
```

There is normally no need to install your built copy of Python because which is already installed by Linux distributions, refer to [Python Installation](#python-installation).

## Python pre-Installation

The Python is already installed on my LinuxMint system:

# Python Language

Python documentation:

* [Python 2.x Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/)
* [Python 3.x Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

For C or C++ programmers, two additional manuals exist:

* [Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html#extending-index) describes the high-level picture of how to write a Python extension module
* [Python/C API Reference Manual](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html#c-api-index) describes the interfaces available to C/C++ programmers in detail

## Keywords

The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or *keywords* of the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. They must be spelled exactly as written here:

```
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise
```

## Operators

The following tokens are operators:

```
+       -       *       **      /       //      %      @
<<      >>      &       |       ^       ~
<       >       <=      >=      ==      !=
```

![Python_Operator_Precedence](/assets/Python_Operators.png)

Python operator precedence:

![Python_Operator_Precedence](/assets/Python_Operator_Precedence.png)

## Delimiters

The following tokens serve as delimiters in the grammar:

```
(       )       [       ]       {       }
,       :       .       ;       @       =       ->
+=      -=      *=      /=      //=     %=      @=
&=      |=      ^=      >>=     <<=     **=
```

The period can also occur in floating-point and imaginary literals. A sequence of three periods has a special meaning as an ellipsis literal. The second half of the list, the augmented assignment operators, serve lexically as delimiters, but also perform an operation.

The following printing ASCII characters have special meaning as part of other tokens or are otherwise significant to the lexical analyzer:

```
'       "       #       \
```

The following printing ASCII characters are not used in Python. Their occurrence outside string literals and comments is an unconditional error:

```
$       ?       `
```

## Comments

**One Line Comments**

Typically, you just use the pound sign (```#```) to comment out everything that follows it on that line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.

```
#print("Am a comment")
```

**Multiple Line Comments**

Multiple line comments simply use 3 single quotes (```'''```) before and after the part you want commented:

```
'''
print("We are in a comment")
print("We are still in a comment")
'''
print("We are out of the comment")
```

# Python Commands

## Command Options

When invoking Python, you may specify any of these options, refer to [command line and environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html):

```
python [-bBdEhiIOqsSuvVWx?] [-c command | -m module-name | script | - ] [args]
```

| Options | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| ```-?```<br>```-h```<br>```--help``` | Print a short description of all command line options. |
| ```-V```<br>```--version```<br>```-VV``` | Print the Python version number and exit. When given twice (```-VV```), print more information about the build. |
| ```-b```<br>```-bb``` | Issue a warning when comparing ```bytes``` or ```bytearray``` with ```str``` or ```bytes``` with ```int```. Issue an error when the option is given twice (```-bb```). Changed in version 3.5: Affects comparisons of ```bytes``` with ```int```. |
| ```-B``` | If given, Python won’t try to write **.pyc** files on the import of source modules. See also **PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE**. |
| ```-d``` | Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only, depending on compilation options). See also **PYTHONDEBUG**. |
| ```-E``` | Ignore all **PYTHON\*** environment variables, e.g. **PYTHONPATH** and **PYTHONHOME**, that might be set. |
| ```-i``` | When a script is passed as first argument or the ```-c``` option is used, enter **interactive mode** after executing the script or the command, even when **sys.stdin** does not appear to be a terminal. The **PYTHONSTARTUP** file is not read. This can be useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception. See also **PYTHONINSPECT**. |
| ```-I``` | Run Python in **isolated mode**. This also implies **-E** and **-s**. In isolated mode **sys.path** contains neither the script’s directory nor the user’s site-packages directory. All **PYTHON\*** environment variables are ignored too. Further restrictions may be imposed to prevent the user from injecting malicious code. New in version 3.4. |
| ```-O``` | Turn on basic optimizations. See also **PYTHONOPTIMIZE**. |
| ```-OO``` | Discard *docstrings* in addition to the **-O** optimizations. |
| ```-q``` | Don’t display the copyright and version messages even in **interactive mode**. New in version 3.2. |
| ```-R``` | Kept for compatibility. On Python 3.3 and greater, hash randomization is turned on by default. On previous versions of Python, this option turns on hash randomization, so that the ```__hash__()``` values of ```str```, ```bytes``` and ```datetime``` are salted with an unpredictable random value. Although they remain constant within an individual Python process, they are not predictable between repeated invocations of Python. |
| ```-s``` | Don’t add the user site-packages directory to **sys.path**. |
| ```-S``` | Disable the import of the module site and the site-dependent manipulations of **sys.path** that it entails. Also disable these manipulations if site is explicitly imported later (call ```site.main()``` if you want them to be triggered). |
| ```-u``` | Force the binary layer of the **stdout** and **stderr** streams (which is available as their buffer attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console, or block-buffered if redirected to a non-interactive file. See also **PYTHONUNBUFFERED**. |
| ```-v```<br>```-vv``` | Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded. When given twice (```-vv```), print a message for each file that is checked for when searching for a module. Also provides information on module cleanup at exit. See also **PYTHONVERBOSE**. |
| ```-W arg``` | Warning control. Python’s warning machinery by default prints warning messages to **sys.stderr**. |
| ```-x``` | Skip the first line of the source, allowing use of non-Unix forms of ```#!cmd```. This is intended for a **DOS specific hack only**. |
| ```-X``` | Reserved for various implementation-specific options. |
| ```-J``` | Reserved for use by **Jython**. You shouldn’t use this option. |

<p/>

Run the following command to print a short description of all command line options:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ python -V
Python 2.7.12
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ python -h
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-B     : don't write .py[co] files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : debug output from parser; also PYTHONDEBUG=x
-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit (also --help)
-i     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
         if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
-m mod : run library module as a script (terminates option list)
-O     : optimize generated bytecode slightly; also PYTHONOPTIMIZE=x
-OO    : remove doc-strings in addition to the -O optimizations
-R     : use a pseudo-random salt to make hash() values of various types be
         unpredictable between separate invocations of the interpreter, as
         a defense against denial-of-service attacks
-Q arg : division options: -Qold (default), -Qwarn, -Qwarnall, -Qnew
-s     : don't add user site directory to sys.path; also PYTHONNOUSERSITE
-S     : don't imply 'import site' on initialization
-t     : issue warnings about inconsistent tab usage (-tt: issue errors)
-u     : unbuffered binary stdout and stderr; also PYTHONUNBUFFERED=x
         see man page for details on internal buffering relating to '-u'
-v     : verbose (trace import statements); also PYTHONVERBOSE=x
         can be supplied multiple times to increase verbosity
-V     : print the Python version number and exit (also --version)
-W arg : warning control; arg is action:message:category:module:lineno
         also PYTHONWARNINGS=arg
-x     : skip first line of source, allowing use of non-Unix forms of #!cmd
-3     : warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix
file   : program read from script file
-      : program read from stdin (default; interactive mode if a tty)
arg ...: arguments passed to program in sys.argv[1:]

Other environment variables:
PYTHONSTARTUP: file executed on interactive startup (no default)
PYTHONPATH   : ':'-separated list of directories prefixed to the
               default module search path.  The result is sys.path.
PYTHONHOME   : alternate <prefix> directory (or <prefix>:<exec_prefix>).
               The default module search path uses <prefix>/pythonX.X.
PYTHONCASEOK : ignore case in 'import' statements (Windows).
PYTHONIOENCODING: Encoding[:errors] used for stdin/stdout/stderr.
PYTHONHASHSEED: if this variable is set to 'random', the effect is the same
   as specifying the -R option: a random value is used to seed the hashes of
   str, bytes and datetime objects.  It can also be set to an integer
   in the range [0,4294967295] to get hash values with a predictable seed.
```

Or, you can find descriptions of those options in man page:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ man python
```

Or, run the following command to print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded:

## Environment Variables

The environment variables influence Python’s behavior, they are processed **before** the command-line switches other than ```-E``` or ```-I```. It is customary that command-line switches override environmental variables where there is a conflict. Refer to [command line and environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html) for details.
