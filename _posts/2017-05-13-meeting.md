# How to Participate Online Meeting

With so many companies now choosing to conduct crucial meetings online, being an active and valuable online meeting participant has become an important ​workplace skill. Online meetings create a great opportunity for the exchange of ideas between dispersed employees who might not get to interact in person on a regular basis, establishing them as valuable team members and creating camaraderie amongst employees.

* **Be on Time**

    If something is preventing you from attending an online meeting on time, let the organizer know. Keep in mind that online meeting software lets the participants know who is logging in, and when.

    Have some water or go to the restroom before the meeting due to online meetings usually do not go on for hours, so there is no natural break for you to excuse yourself.

    Also, don't sneak out of the meeting without letting anyone know - you never know when someone might ask you a question. If you have an emergency, let the meeting organizer know that you must step out for a few minutes, and you will let them know when you are back. The best way to do this is through your online meeting software's chat facility, so you don't disrupt the presenter.

* **Keep a Professional Demeanor**

    While you might be attending your online meeting from the comfort of your desk or even your home, your tone should be no less formal than if you were in a boardroom, surrounded by your peers and superiors.

* **Don't Plan on Just Listening In**

    Just because the meeting is online, it is no excuse for you to work on something else while only listening in. If you have been invited to the meeting, it's because the presenter values your input. Even if there isn't much of a chance for participation, you should still be actively taking notes. The online meeting that you happened to work on something else through, might just have something that will prove important to you. If you need to finish any work the same day as the meeting, either state that you are not available to attend the meeting on that day, or organize yourself well enough so that you won't have to work through it.

* **Make it a Point to Participate**

    Whether it's asking a question during the Q&A session, sharing your team's achievements or any other appropriate story or idea, plan to have a say in the meeting.

    Any good host will ask for input during the meeting, and will not spend the whole time just talking at the team. Take this as an opportunity to show that you are not only in attendance, but also paying attention. Say your name before you speak, so attendees will know who is addressing them. Keep in mind that you should speak confidently and clearly, as you would during a face-to-face meeting. If your business isn't into informal language, then refrain from using it even though an online setting might feel more informal than a face-to-face one.

* **Practice Before the Meeting**

    If you have been asked to share a slide, or to make a presentation during the meeting, you should ensure that not only is it done to the standards required by the organizer, but that you have also practiced the delivery of your materials.

    If this is your first online meeting using a certain software, ask the meeting organizer if they could do a dry run with you, to make sure that you're comfortable using the software. If you are already familiar with the software, then just practice the presentation. Know what you are going to say, and avoid reading from a cue during your presentation. Reading certain facts and figures is fine, but you don't want to sound like those telemarketing operators who cold-call you. Make sure that your presentation flows and is delivered smoothly.

* **Do Not Speak Out of Turn**

    If it is someone else's turn to present, let them finish without interruptions. Wait until they are done and then comment or ask questions. Unless the presenter has specified that it is OK for participants to interrupt the presentation, refrain from speaking when it's someone else's turn. Otherwise not only will the meeting be delayed, but it can also go off-topic. Keep in mind that those participating in online meetings don't have the opportunity to give visual cues that they would like to speak, letting the presenter neatly wrap up a point they want to make before taking the comment or question. So any interruption will be vocal, disrupting the natural flow of the meeting.

# Online Meeting Tools

* [Skype for Busines](https://products.office.com/zh-cn/skype-for-business/online-meetings)

    

* [Adobe Connect Pro](http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect.html)

    Adobe is the well-known company that has brought us Flash, a widely used online video format. Connect Pro is one of Adobe’s lesser known products, however, it is still a solid choice when it comes to online meetings.

    It is not for the beginner user because even though it has a beautiful interface, it can be difficult to use due to its large number of features and the fact that it takes a while to really get to know them. Users can create polls, access meetings from an iPhone or iPod Touch, video conference and easily share a variety of media. In addition, this is great software for a larger meeting, since it can accommodate up to 200 people.

* [Dimdim](http://dimdim.com/)

    This is a relatively new online meeting tool. Compared to competitors, it is a great value for the money as it is loaded with useful features like VoIP and screen sharing. As it is based on your web browser, there are no compatibility issues with your operating system, so it doesn’t matter whether you are on a PC, Mac or Linux.

     The software has a free version for meetings of up to 20 participants. However, if you need to host more people, there is the option to go Pro. On this version, meetings may have up to 50 people and can be branded.

    Dimdim also offers larger meeting options, which accommodate up to 1,000 people. It is the most user-friendly online meeting tool, with an easy to navigate interface that is highly intuitive. What’s more, hosts can customize the entire meeting room, so it is useful and interesting for attendees.

* [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/)

    Made by Citrix Online, GoToMeeting is an online meeting program specifically useful for small companies.

    It supports meetings of up to 15 people and allows for meeting recording, screen sharing and chatting between participants. In its Corporate version, meetings can have up to 25 people. While the user interface isn’t very attractive, GoToMeeting is great at being very intuitive and extremely easy to use, so it takes very little time to get to know the program’s capabilities and features. One downside is that before a meeting can start, attendees need to download a client so they can access all of the software’s features.

* [Microsoft Office Live Meeting](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-the-Microsoft-Office-Live-Meeting-Console-8a432d04-45ac-4762-8e7f-e715dcd0f167)

    Along with WebEx, this is perhaps one of the best-known online meeting tools. Its functionality spans from basic meetings all the way to web conferences and even online learning sessions. Unlike GoToMeeting, for example, meeting attendees do not have to download a client in order to gain the software’s basic functionality, so joining a meeting is quick and easy.

    The software includes an Outlook add-on that lets users schedule online meetings the same way as face-to-face ones, so if you are familiar with Outlook, setting up meetings with LiveMeeting will be second nature.

    While the software does cater to small companies, it shines as a corporate tool, since its more advanced features require a dedicated server (and the expensive licensing that comes with it). One feature that stands out from competitors is search. Live Meeting users can search current and past meeting documents (but not audio or video) for specific content.

* [WebEx Meeting Center](https://www.webex.com/)

    WebEx is the umbrella name given to Cisco Systems' large array of online meeting tools which serve from small meetings to large conferences. Meeting Center is a popular part of this range of products, and holds collaborative working at its core. What sets this tool aside from its competitors is the ability for hosts and participants to keep a number of meeting-related content on their screen simultaneously and resize or move them around as they like.

    The tool is also integrated with Outlook, so it is easy to start a meeting or send invitations directly from the program. It is a relatively easy to use tool, although it does require some training so users can make the most of its functionality.
