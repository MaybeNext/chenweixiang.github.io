# Brief Introduction

Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers **write once, run anywhere (WORA)**, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any **Java virtual machine (JVM)** regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by **James Gosling** at *Sun Microsystems* (which has since been acquired by *Oracle Corporation*) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from **C** and **C++**, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. Refer to [Java Overview](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) for more information.

## Java Principles

There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:

* It must be **simple, object-oriented, and familiar**.
* It must be **robust and secure**.
* It must be **architecture-neutral and portable**.
* It must execute with **high performance**.
* It must be **interpreted, threaded, and dynamic**.

## Java Versions

As of 2015, only **Java 8** is officially supported. Here is major release versions of Java, along with their release dates. Refer to [Java version history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history).

| Java Version | Internal Version | Release_Date | Codename   | Classes | Packages |
| :----------- | :--------------: | :----------: | :--------- | :-----: | :------: |
| JDK 1.0      | 1.0.0            | Jan 23, 1996 |            | 212     | 8        |

<p/>

Since **J2SE 1.4**, the evolution of the Java language has been governed by the [**Java Community Process (JCP)**](#java-community-process), which uses **Java Specification Requests (JSRs)** to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The language is specified by the **Java Language Specification (JLS)**; changes to the JLS are managed under [JSR 901](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=901).

## Java Community Process

The **Java Community Process (JCP)**, established in 1998, is a formalized mechanism that allows interested parties to develop standard technical specifications for Java technology. Anyone can become a JCP Member by filling a form available at the [JCP website](https://www.jcp.org/). JCP membership for organizations and commercial entities requires annual fees but is free for individuals.

The JCP involves the use of **Java Specification Requests (JSRs)** the formal documents that describe proposed specifications and technologies for adding to the Java platform. Formal public reviews of JSRs take place before a JSR becomes *final* and the *JCP Executive Committee* votes on it. A final JSR provides a *reference implementation* that is a free implementation of the technology in source code form and a Technology Compatibility Kit to verify the API specification.

A JSR describes the JCP itself. As of 2009, [JSR 215](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=215) describes the current version (2.7) of the JCP.

List of JSRs:

* [List of all JSRs rated final](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/stage?listBy=final)
* [List of all JSRs](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/all)

Refer to [Java Language and Virtual Machine Specifications](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/index.html):

* [The Java Language Specification - Java SE 8 Edition](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/index.html)

# Java Plantform SE

## Java Plantform SE Architecture

The following conceptual diagram illustrates the components of Oracle's **Java SE** products, refer to [Java Platform Standard Edition 8 Documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/):

![Java SE 8 Conceptual Diagram](/assets/JavaSE8_Conceptual_Diagram.png)

Oracle has two software products that implement **Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE) 8**:

* **Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) 8**

    The **JRE** provides the libraries, [Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](#java-virtual-machine-jvm), and other components necessary for you to ***run*** applets and applications written in the Java programming language. *This runtime environment can be redistributed with applications to make them free-standing*. Note that the **JRE** includes components not required by the [Java SE specification](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/index.html), including both standard and non-standard Java components.

* **Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8**

    The **JDK** is a superset of **JRE**, and contains everything that is in **JRE**, plus command-line development tools such as compilers and debuggers that are necessary or useful for ***developing*** applets and applications.

## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

A [**Java virtual machine (JVM)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. There are three notions of the JVM: *specification*, *implementation*, and *instance*. The *specification* is a document that formally describes what is required of a JVM implementation. Having a single specification ensures all implementations are interoperable. A JVM *implementation* is a computer program that meets the requirements of the JVM specification. An *instance* of a JVM is an implementation running in a process that executes a computer program compiled into Java bytecode.

**Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** is a software package that contains what is required to run a Java program. It includes a Java Virtual Machine implementation together with an implementation of the Java Class Library. The Oracle Corporation, which owns the Java trademark, distributes a Java Runtime environment with their Java Virtual Machine called [HotSpot](http://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/).

**Java Development Kit (JDK)** is a superset of a JRE and contains tools for Java programmers, e.g. a javac compiler. The Java Development Kit is provided free of charge either by Oracle Corporation directly, or by the [OpenJDK](#openjdk) open source project, which is governed by Oracle.

Refer to [The Java Virtual Machine Specification - Java SE 8 Edition](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/index.html).

![Overview of Java virtual machine (JVM) architecture based on Java SE 7](/assets/JvmSpec7.png)

The JDK provides one or more implementations of the Java virtual machine (VM), refer to [Java Virtual Machine Technology](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/index.html):

* On platforms typically used for client applications, the JDK comes with a VM implementation called the **Java HotSpot Client VM** (*client VM*). The *client VM* is tuned for reducing start-up time and memory footprint. It can be invoked by using the ```-client``` command-line option when launching an application.

* On all platforms, the JDK comes with an implementation of the Java virtual machine called the **Java HotSpot Server VM** (*server VM*). The *server VM* is designed for maximum program execution speed. It can be invoked by using the ```-server``` command-line option when launching an application.

### Basic Tools

**apt**

```
apt [options] sourcefiles
```

Annotation Processing Tool

**extcheck**

```
extcheck [-verbose] jarfile
```

JAR Version Conflict Utility

**jarsigner**

```
jarsigner [options] jarfile signer
jarsigner -verify jarfile
```

JAR Signing and Verification Tool


**jar**

```
jar c|t|u|x[f][m][M][0][v] [jar-file] [manifest] [-C directory] [input-files]
jar i [jar-file]
```

Java Archive Tool

**java**

```
java [ interpreter-options ] classname [ program-arguments ]
java [ interpreter-options ] -jar jarfile [ program-arguments ]
```

*java* is the Java byte-code interpreter; it runs Java programs. The program to be run is the class specified by *classname*. This must be a fully qualified name: it must include the package name of the class but not the *.class* file extension.

The specified class must define a *main()* method with exactly the following signature:
```
public static void main(String[] args)
```

This method serves as the program entry point: the interpreter begins execution here.

**javac**

```
javac [ options ] files
```

*javac* is the Java compiler; it compiles Java source code (in *.java* files) into Java byte codes (in *.class* files). The Java compiler is itself written in Java.

# Implementations of Java Platform SE

## OpenJDK

[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) is a free and open source implementation of the **Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE)**.

Before OpenJDK, several free Java implementations were made by various companies and groups. One example is Apache Harmony. IBM also provides Java implementations, and RedHat provides it through the IcedTea project: a build and integration project for OpenJDK.

# Java Compiling and Execution

In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the *.java* extension. Those source files are then compiled into *.class* files by the ```javac``` compiler. A *.class* file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes — the machine language of the [Java Virtual Machine (Java VM)](#java-virtual-machine-jvm). The ```java``` launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java Virtual Machine.

![An overview of the software development process](/assets/Java_Compiler.gif)

Because the Java VM is available on many different operating systems, the same *.class* files are capable of running on Microsoft Windows, the Solaris™ Operating System (Solaris OS), Linux, or Mac OS. Some virtual machines, such as the [Java SE HotSpot at a Glance](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136373.html), perform additional steps at runtime to give your application a performance boost. This includes various tasks such as finding performance bottlenecks and recompiling (to native code) frequently used sections of code. Refer to [About the Java Technology](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/intro/definition.html).

![Through the Java VM, the same application is capable of running on multiple platforms](/assets/Java_application_running_on_multiple_platforms.gif)

# Java Language

## Keywords

Here is a list of keywords in the Java programming language. You cannot use any of the following as identifiers in your programs. The keywords ```const``` and ```goto``` are reserved, even though they are not currently used. ```true```, ```false```, and ```null``` might seem like keywords, but they are actually literals; you cannot use them as identifiers in your programs.

| ```abstract```   | ```continue``` | ```for```        | ```new```          | ```switch```       |
| ```assert``` [3] | ```default```  | ```goto``` [1]   | ```package```      | ```synchronized``` |
| ```boolean```    | ```do```       | ```if```         | ```private```      | ```this```         |
| ```break```      | ```double```   | ```implements``` | ```protected```    | ```throw```        |
| ```byte```       | ```else```     | ```import```     | ```public```       | ```throws```       |

## Operators

As we explore the operators of the Java programming language, it may be helpful for you to know ahead of time which operators have the highest precedence. The operators in the following table are listed according to precedence order. The closer to the top of the table an operator appears, the higher its precedence. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with relatively lower precedence. Operators on the same line have equal precedence. When operators of equal precedence appear in the same expression, a rule must govern which is evaluated first. All binary operators except for the assignment operators are evaluated from left to right; assignment operators are evaluated right to left. Refer to [Operators](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html) and [Summary of Operators](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/opsummary.html).

**Operator Precedence**

| Operators            | Precedence |
| :------------------- | :--------- |
| postfix              | ```expr++``` ```expr--``` |
| unary                | ```++expr``` ```--expr``` ```+expr``` ```-expr``` ```~``` ```!``` |
| multiplicative       | ```*``` ```/``` ```%``` |
| additive             | ```+``` ```-``` |
| shift                | ```<<``` ```>>``` ```>>>``` |
| relational           | ```<``` ```>``` ```<=``` ```>=``` ```instanceof``` |
| equality             | ```==``` ```!=``` |
| bitwise AND          | ```&``` |
| bitwise exclusive OR | ```^``` |
| bitwise inclusive OR | ```|``` |
| logical AND          | ```&&``` |
| logical OR           | ```||``` |
| ternary              | ```? :``` |
| assignment           | ```=``` ```+=``` ```-=``` ```*=``` ```/=``` ```%=``` ```&=``` ```^=``` ```|=``` ```<<=``` ```>>=``` ```>>>=``` |

<p/>

![Java Operators](/assets/Java_operators.png)

**Simple Assignment Operator**

| ```=``` | Simple assignment operator |

<p/>

**Arithmetic Operators**

| ```+```  | Additive operator (also used for String concatenation) |
| ```-```  | Subtraction operator    |
| ```*```  | Multiplication operator |
| ```/```  | Division operator       |
| ```%```  | Remainder operator      |

<p/>

**Unary Operators**

| ```+```  | Unary plus operator; indicates positive value (numbers are positive without this, however) |
| ```-```  | Unary minus operator; negates an expression |
| ```++``` | Increment operator; increments a value by 1 |
| ```--``` | Decrement operator; decrements a value by 1 |
| ```!```  | Logical complement operator; inverts the value of a boolean |

<p/>

**Equality and Relational Operators**

| ```==``` | Equal to         |
| ```!=``` | Not equal to     |
| ```>```  | Greater than     |
| ```<```  | Less than        |
| ```>=``` | Greater than or equal to |
| ```<=``` | Less than or equal to    |

<p/>

**Conditional Operators**

| ```&&``` | Conditional-AND |
| ```||``` | Conditional-OR  |
| ```?:``` | Ternary (shorthand for ```if-then-else``` statement) |

<p/>

**Type Comparison Operator**

| ```instanceof``` | Compares an object to a specified type |

<p/>

* The ```instanceof``` operator requires an object or array value as its left operand and the name of a reference type as its right operand. It evaluates to ```true``` if the object or array is an instance of the specified type; it returns ```false``` otherwise.
* If the left operand is ```null```, ```instanceof``` always evaluates to ```false```.
* If an ```instanceof``` expression evaluates to ```true```, it means that you can safely cast and assign the left operand to a variable of the type of the right operand.
* The ```instanceof``` operator can be used only with reference types and objects, not primitive types and values.

**Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators**

| ```~```   | Unary bitwise complement |
| ```<<```  | shift left               |
| ```>>```  | shift right              |
| ```>>>``` | Unsigned shift right     |
| ```&```   | Bitwise AND              |
| ```^```   | Bitwise exclusive OR     |
| ```|```   | Bitwise inclusive OR     |

<p/>

* The ```<<``` operator shifts the bits of the left operand left by the number of places specified by the right operand. **High-order bits of the left operand are lost, and zero bits are shifted in from the right**.
* The ```>>``` operator shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of places specified by the right operand. **The low-order bits of the left operand are shifted away and are lost. The high-order bits shifted in are the same as the original high-order bit of the left operand**.
* This ```>>>``` operator is like the ```>>``` operator, except that **it always shifts zeros into the high-order bits of the result**, regardless of the sign of the left-hand operand. This technique is called *zero extension*; it is appropriate when the left operand is being treated as an unsigned value (despite the fact that Java integer types are all signed).

## Comments

Java has the following three kinds of comments, refer to [Javadoc tool documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/index.html):

```
// comments until the end of the line

/*
 * multiline comment
 */

/**
 * documentation comment (doc comment, for short)
 *
 * the javadoc tool uses doc comments when preparing
 * automatically generated documentation.
 */
```

## Primitive Data Types

Java has the following primitive data types:

| Type    | Bits | Contains | Default | Range |
| :------ | :--- | :------- | :------ | :---- |
| boolean | 1    | true or false | false | NA |
| char    | 16   | Unicode Character Set | \u0000  | \u0000 .. \uFFFF |
| byte    | 8    | Signed integer | 0 | -128 .. 127 |
| short   | 16   | Signed integer | 0 | -32,768 .. 32,767 |
| int     | 32   | Signed integer | 0 | -2,147,483,648 .. 2,147,483,647 |
| long    | 64   | Signed integer | 0 | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 .. 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float   | 32   | IEEE 754 floating point | 0.0 | ±1.4E-45 .. ±3.4028235E+38 |
| double  | 64   | IEEE 754 floating point | 0.0 | ±4.9E-324 .. ±1.7976931348623157E+308 |

<p/>

Declare a variable:

```
{public | private} [static] type identifier [= expression];
```

**boolean**

* C and C++ programmers should note that Java is quite strict about its *boolean* type: *boolean* values can never be converted to or from other data types.
* *boolean* is not an integral type, and integer values cannot be used in place of a *boolean*.

**char**

* *char* values can be converted to and from the various integral types.
* Unlike *byte*, *short*, *int*, and *long*, however, *char* is an unsigned type.
* *char* acts like an integer type in most ways, so a *char* value can be used anywhere an *int* or *long* value is required.
* Unicode standard is evolving, and each new version of Java adopts the latest version of Unicode. Java 1.4 used Unicode 3.0 and Java 5.0 adopts Unicode 4.0.

**Integer types: byte, short, int, long**

* All integral types represent signed numbers; there is no unsigned keyword as there is in C and C++.
* Integer literals can also be expressed in hexadecimal (0x123) or octal notation (0123). Java does not allow integer literals to be expressed in binary (base-2) notation.
* Integer literals are 32-bit *int* values unless they end with the character ```L``` or ```l```, in which case they are 64-bit *long* values.
* Each integer type has a corresponding wrapper class: *Byte*, *Short*, *Integer*, and *Long*. Each of these classes defines **MIN_VALUE** and **MAX_VALUE** constants that describe the range of the type.

**Floating-Point types: float, double**

* Real numbers in Java are represented by the *float* and *double* data types.
* Floating-point literals are *double* values by default. To include a *float* value literally in a program, follow the number with ```F``` or ```f```.
* Floating-point literals cannot be expressed in hexadecimal or octal notation.
* In addition to representing ordinary numbers, the *float* and *double* types can also represent four special values: positive and negative infinity, zero, and NaN. The infinity values result when a floating-point computation produces a value that overflows the representable range of a float or double. When a floating-point computation underflows the representable range of a float or a double, a zero value results. NaN stands for *not-a-number*. The NaN value results when an illegal floating-point operation, such as 0.0/0.0, is performed.
* Because the Java floating-point types can handle overflow to infinity and underflow to zero and have a special NaN value, **floating-point arithmetic never throws exceptions**, even when performing illegal operations, like dividing zero by zero or taking the square root of a negative number.
* The *float* and *double* primitive types have corresponding classes, named *Float* and *Double*. Each of these classes defines the following useful constants: MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE, NEGATIVE_INFINITY, POSITIVE_INFINITY, and NaN.

#### Primitive Type Conversions

There are two basic types of conversions:

* *Widening conversion* occurs when a value of one type is converted to a wider type — one that has a larger range of legal values. Java performs widening conversions automatically when, for example, you assign an int literal to a double variable or a char literal to an int variable.
* *Narrowing conversions* are another matter, however. A narrowing conversion occurs when a value is converted to a type that is not wider than it is.

The following table shows which primitive types can be converted to which other types and how the conversion is performed.

![Java Primitive Type Conversions](/assets/Java_primitive_type_conversions.png)

* The letter **N** in the table means that the conversion cannot be performed.
* The letter **Y** means that the conversion is a *widening conversion* and is therefore performed automatically and implicitly by Java.
* The letter **C** means that the conversion is a *narrowing conversion* and requires an explicit cast.
* The notation **Y\*** means that the conversion is an automatic *widening conversion*, but that some of the least significant digits of the value may be lost in the conversion.

## Arrays

Declare an integer array and allocate 100 elements of memory:

```
int array_name[];
array_name=new int[100];
```

Declare and allocate an integer array in one statement:

```
int array_name[] = new int [100];
int array_name[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

Multidimensional array:

```
int array_name[] = new int[10][20];
```

For reference type (class, array):

```
null
```

## Flow Control Statements

**if..else**

```
if (Boolean-expression)
    statement1;
[ else statement2; ]
```

**while**

```
[initialization]
while (termination-clause) {
    body;
    [iteration;]
}
```

**do while**

```
do {
    body;
    [iteration;]
} while (termination-clause);
```

**for**

```
for (initialization; termination-clause; iteration)
{
    body;
}
```

**for/in**

```
for (declaration : expression)
{
	statement;
}
```

* *expression* must be either an array or an object that implements the *java.lang.Iterable* interface.
* The type of the array or Iterable elements must be assignment-compatible with the type of the variable declared in the *declaration*.

**Program Structure**

```
{public | final | abstract} class className {
    public static void main (String args[ ]) {
        statements;
    }

    method definition1
    ...
    method definitionN
}
```
