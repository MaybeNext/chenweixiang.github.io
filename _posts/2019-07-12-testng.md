# Overview

[TestNG](https://testng.org/) is a testing framework for the Java programming language created by *CÃ©dric Beust* and inspired by [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) and [NUnit](http://nunit.org/). TestNG introduces some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

* Annotations.
* Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc...).
* Test that your code is multithread safe.
* Flexible test configuration.
* Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
* Support for parameters.
* Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
* Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc...).
* Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility.
* Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies).
* Dependent methods for application server testing.

TestNG is designed to cover all categories of tests:  unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc...
