# CPRI Introduction

The **Common Public Radio Interface** (**CPRI**) is an industry cooperation aimed at defining a publicly available specification for the key internal interface of Radio Base Stations (RBS) between the Radio Equipment Control (REC) and the Radio Equipment (RE). The parties cooperating to define the specification are **Ericsson AB**, **Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd**, **NEC Corporation**, **Nortel Networks SA and Siemens AG**.

# Scope of CPRI Spec

* **User Plane data, Control Plane transport mechanisms, and means for synchronisation**

	* **User Plane**: Data that has to be transferred from the Radio Base Station (RBS) to the Mobile Station (MS), and vice versa.
	* **Control Plane**: Control data flow used for call processing.
	* **Management Plane**: This data is management information for the operation, administration and maintenance of the CPRI link and the nodes.
	* **Synchronization**: Data flow which transfers synchronization and timing information between nodes (RECs, REs).
	<p/>

* **Cover Layers 1 and 2 of OSI stack**

	* The physical layer (layer 1) will support both an electrical interface (i.e. what is used in traditional base stations), and an optical interface (e.g. for base stations with remote radio equipment). It defines:

		* Electrical characteristics
		* Optical characteristics
		* Time division multiplexing of the different data flows
		* Low level signalling
		<p/>

	* The data link layer (layer 2) shall support flexibility and scalability. It defines:

		* Media access control
		* Flow control
		* Data protection of the control and management information flow
		<p/>

# System Architecture

The following figures show the basic system architecture and CPRI definition:

![CPRI_System_Architecture_1](/assets/CPRI_System_Architecture_1.png)

![CPRI_System_Architecture_2](/assets/CPRI_System_Architecture_2.png)

In addition to the user plane data (IQ data), control and management as well as synchronization signals have to be exchanged between the REC and the RE. **All information flows are multiplexed onto a digital serial communication line** using appropriate layer 1 and layer 2 protocols. The different information flows have access to the layer 2 via appropriate Service Access Points (SAP).

## Functional Decomposition

The REC is concerned with the Network Interface transport, the radio base station control and management as well as the digital baseband processing. The RE provides the analogue and radio frequency functions such as filtering, modulation, frequency conversion and amplification.

The following figure shows the functional decomposition between REC and RE for **WiMAX & E-UTRA**:

### 8b/10b Line Coding

In telecommunications, 8b/10b is a line code that maps 8-bit words to 10-bit symbols to achieve DC-balance and bounded disparity, and yet provide enough state changes to allow reasonable clock recovery. **This means that the difference between the counts of ones and zeros in a string of at least 20 bits is no more than two, and that there are not more than five ones or zeros in a row**. This helps to reduce the demand for the lower bandwidth limit of the channel necessary to transfer the signal.

An 8b/10b code can be implemented in various ways, where the design may focus on specific parameters such as hardware requirements, DC-balance, etc. One implementation was designed by *K. Odaka* for the DAT digital audio recorder. *Kees Schouhamer Immink* designed an 8b/10b code for the DCC audio recorder. The IBM implementation was described in 1983 by *Al Widmer* and *Peter Franaszek*.

As the scheme name suggests, eight bits of data are transmitted as a 10-bit entity called a *symbol*, or *character*. The low five bits of data are encoded into a 6-bit group (the **5b/6b portion**) and the top three bits are encoded into a 4-bit group (the **3b/4b portion**). These code groups are concatenated together to form the 10-bit symbol that is transmitted on the wire.

Refer to [8b/10b encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8b/10b_encoding) for more information.

### 64b/66b Line Coding

In data networking and transmission, 64b/66b is a line code that transforms 64-bit data to 66-bit line code to provide enough state changes to allow reasonable clock recovery and facilitate alignment of the data stream at the receiver. It was defined by the IEEE 802.3 working group as part of the IEEE 802.3ae-2002 amendment which introduced 10 Gbit/s Ethernet.

The Protocol overhead of a coding scheme is the ratio of the number of added coding bits to the number of raw payload bits. The overhead of 64b/66b encoding is 2 overhead bits for every 64 raw bits transmitted or 3.125%. This is considerably more efficient than the 25% overhead of the previously used 8b/10b encoding scheme which essentially charges every 8 bits of source data with a 2 bit (or 25%) tax. At the time 64b/66b was deployed, it allowed 10 Gb Ethernet to be transmitted with the same lasers used by SONET OC-192, rather than requiring 12.5 Gbit/s lasers, which were not expected to become available for several years.

The overhead can be reduced further by doubling the block size to produce 128b/130b encoding, as used by PCIe 3.0, and a very similar variant is the 128b/132b encoding used by USB 3.1.

Refer to [64b/66b encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64b/66b_encoding) for more information.
