This article introduces the **C** programming language.

<!--more-->

# Overview

The **C** programming language was developed in 1972 by *Dennis Ritchie* and *Brian Kernighan* at the AT&T Corporation for programming computer operating systems. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the composition of smaller units is comparable to that of ALGOL. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in systems programming, and C shares with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computerâ€™s internal architecture. C++, along with its descendant C++++, remains one of the most common languages.

# Operator Priority

| Operators                                               | Associativity     |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------: |
| `()` `[]` `->` `.`                                      | left to right     |
| `!` `~` `++` `--` `+` `-` `(type)` `*` `&` `sizeof`     | **right to left** |
| `*` `/` `%`                                             | left to right     |
| `+` `-`                                                 | left to right     |
| `<<` `>>`                                               | left to right     |
| `<` `<=` `>` `>=`                                       | left to right     |
| `==` `!=`                                               | left to right     |
| `&`                                                     | left to right     |
| `^`                                                     | left to right     |
| `|`                                                     | left to right     |
| `&&`                                                    | left to right     |
| `||`                                                    | left to right     |
| `?:`                                                    | **right to left** |
| `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `<<=` `>>=` `&=` `^=` `|=` | **right to left** |
| `,`                                                     | left to right     |

Run the following command to get the operator priority under Linux environment:

    chenwx@chenwx ~ $ man operator

    NAME

    DESCRIPTION
           This manual page lists C operators and their precedence in evaluation.
