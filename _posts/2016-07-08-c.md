This article introduces the **C** programming language.

<!--more-->

# Overview

The **C** programming language was developed in 1972 by *Dennis Ritchie* and *Brian Kernighan* at the AT&T Corporation for programming computer operating systems. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the composition of smaller units is comparable to that of ALGOL. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in systems programming, and C shares with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computerâ€™s internal architecture. C++, along with its descendant C++++, remains one of the most common languages.
