# Overview

According to [Scientific Computing](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Scientific_computing):

Scientific computing is the science of solving problems with computers. The problems themselves usually arise from other disciplines such as mathematics, engineering, biology, physics, chemistry and other natural sciences. As a consequence, scientific computing is interdisciplinary by nature. The dividing line between scientific computing and the sciences from which its problems originate is best described by what scientific computing is *not* -- and what it *is*.

* Computing PI to 22.4 trillion digits is *not* scientific computing. Developing algorithms to efficiently compute PI to any precision *is* scientific computing.
* Running a Molecular dynamics simulation with 1,000,000 atoms for 100 nanoseconds is *not* scientific computing. Developing models and algorithms to efficiently simulate large particle systems *is* scientific computing.
* Computing the eigenvalues of a 1,000 x 1,000 dense, complex matrix is *not* scientific computing. Developing efficient and accurate methods to determine the eigevalues of any large, dense, complex matrix *is* scientific computing.
* Running an all-against-all sequence alignment of every genome known is *not* scientific computing. Developing realistic and efficient models for sequence evolution *is* scientific computing.

The line between scientific computing and the sciences from which its problems are derived is drawn between interest in the *methods* used to solve problems and the *solution* of the problems themselves. In other words, all scientists use computers, but very few do scientific computation.

# MATLAB

Millions of engineers and scientists worldwide use [MATLAB](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/en/products/matlab.html) to analyze and design the systems and products transforming our world. The matrix-based MATLAB language is the worldâ€™s most natural way to express computational mathematics. Built-in graphics make it easy to visualize and gain insights from data. The desktop environment invites experimentation, exploration, and discovery. These MATLAB tools and capabilities are all rigorously tested and designed to work together.

MATLAB helps you take your ideas beyond the desktop. You can run your analyses on larger data sets, and scale up to clusters and clouds. MATLAB code can be integrated with other languages, enabling you to deploy algorithms and applications within web, enterprise, and production systems.

# Mathematica

[Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) is a modern technical computing system spanning most areas of technical computing - including neural networks, machine learning, image processing, geometry, data science, visualizations, and others. The system is used in many technical, scientific, engineering, mathematical, and computing fields. It was conceived by *Stephen Wolfram* and is developed by Wolfram Research of Champaign, Illinois. The Wolfram Language is the programming language used in Mathematica.[9]

# Scilab

[Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/) is a free and open source software for engineers & scientists, with a long history (first release in 1994) and a growing community (100 000 downloads every months worldwide).

# FreeMat

[FreeMat](http://freemat.sourceforge.net/) is a free environment for rapid engineering and scientific prototyping and data processing. It is similar to commercial systems such as MATLAB from Mathworks, and IDL from Research Systems, but is Open Source. FreeMat is available under the GPL license.

# GNU Octave

[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a high-level language primarily intended for numerical computations. It is typically used for such problems as solving linear and nonlinear equations, numerical linear algebra, statistical analysis, and for performing other numerical experiments. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language for automated data processing.

The current version of Octave executes in a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI hosts an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which includes a code editor with syntax highlighting, built-in debugger, documentation browser, as well as the interpreter for the language itself. A command-line interface (CLI) for Octave is also available.

GNU Octave is freely redistributable software. You may redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation. The GPL is included in this manual, see Copying.

[This manual](https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/) provides comprehensive documentation on how to install, run, use, and extend GNU Octave. Additional chapters describe how to report bugs and help contribute code.

# Gnuplot

[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it). It was originally created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data interactively, but has grown to support many non-interactive uses such as web scripting. It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under active development since 1986.

# SciPy

[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing.

SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.

SciPy builds on the **NumPy** array object and is part of the NumPy stack which includes tools like Matplotlib, pandas and SymPy, and an expanding set of scientific computing libraries. This NumPy stack has similar users to other applications such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, and Scilab. The NumPy stack is also sometimes referred to as the SciPy stack.

SciPy is also a family of conferences for users and developers of these tools: SciPy (in the United States), EuroSciPy (in Europe) and SciPy.in (in India). Enthought originated the SciPy conference in the United States and continues to sponsor many of the international conferences as well as host the SciPy website.

The SciPy library is currently distributed under the BSD license, and its development is sponsored and supported by an open community of developers. It is also supported by NumFOCUS, a community foundation for supporting reproducible and accessible science.

# Gmsh

[Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) is a free 3D finite element mesh generator with a built-in CAD engine and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced visualization capabilities. Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is done either interactively using the graphical user interface, in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language (.geo files), or using the C++, C, Python or Julia API.

# Rebol

[Rebol](http://www.rebol.com/) is a lightweight programming language. Rebol's unique design makes it more productive than other language technologies. The leverage comes from Rebol's unique blend of domain specific sub-languages called dialects.
