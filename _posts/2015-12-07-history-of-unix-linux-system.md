# History of Unix/Linux and its variants

| Year | Unix | [BSD](http://www.bsd.org/) | [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) | [System III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_III) |
|:----:|:-----|:----|:----|:----|
| 1957 | Bell Labs found they needed an operating system for their computer center that at the time was running various batch jobs. The BESYS operating system was created at Bell Labs to deal with these needs. | | | |
| 1965 | Bell Labs was adopting third generation computer equipment and decided to join forces with General Electric and MIT to create Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service). | | | |
| 1969 | By April 1969, AT&T made a decision to withdraw Multics and go with GECOS. When Multics was withdrawn Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie needed to rewrite an operating system to play space travel on another smaller machine (a DEC PDP-7 [Programmed Data Processor 4K memory for user programs). The result was a system that a punning colleague called UNICS (UNiplexed Information and Computing Service)--an 'emasculated Multics'. | | | |
| 1969 | Unix was developed on Summer 1969. | | | |
| 1971 | **First edition of Unix released 11/03/1971**. The first edition of the "Unix PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL [by] K. Thompson [and] D. M. Ritchie." It includes over 60 commands like: b (compile B program); boot (reboot system); cat (concatenate files); chdir (change working directory); chmod (change access mode); chown (change owner); cp (copy file); ls (list directory contents); mv (move or rename file); roff (run off text); wc (get word count); who (who is one the system). The main thing missing was pipes. | | | |
