This article introduces the command **scp** (secure copy).

<!--more-->

# Brief Introduction

**scp** copies files between hosts on a network. It uses **ssh** for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security as **ssh**. **scp** will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.

File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the file is to be copied to/from that host. Local file names can be made explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file names containing ':' as host specifiers. Copies between two remote hosts are also permitted.

# Syntax

```
scp [-12346BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
    [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
    [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2
```

Refer to details of above options:

```
$ man scp
```

# Examples

Copy local files to remote host:

```
$ scp <local_file> <remote_username>@<remote_ip>:<remote_folder>
$ scp <local_file> <remote_username>@<remote_ip>:<remote_file>
$ scp <local_file> <remote_ip>:<remote_folder>
$ scp <local_file> <remote_ip>:<remote_file>
```

Copy local folder to remote host:

```
$ scp -r <local_folder> <remote_username>@<remote_ip>:<remote_folder>
$ scp -r <local_folder> <remote_ip>:<remote_folder>
```

Copy files from remote host to local host:

```
$ scp <remote_username>@<remote_ip>:<remote_folder> <local_file>
$ scp <remote_username>@<remote_ip>:<remote_file> <local_file>
$ scp <remote_ip>:<remote_folder> <local_file>
$ scp <remote_ip>:<remote_file> <local_file>
```

Copy folder from remote host to local host:

```
$ scp -r <remote_username>@<remote_ip>:<remote_folder> <local_folder>
$ scp -r <remote_ip>:<remote_folder> <local_folder>
```
